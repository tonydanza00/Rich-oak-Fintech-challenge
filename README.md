# Rich-oak-Fintech-challenge
by  Tony Edgal

Html and CSS were chosen because they both form the basis of responsive web design, while I would have loved to add a little bit of javascript, as a beginner js programmer,I didnt want to risk anything breaking.

the Raleway font is my goto font, it has good legibility and a professional look and I also added fontawesome icons to the footer.

Umba bank is a new Fintech startup in Nigeria ( I did a quick google search), logo and favicons were all eextracted from the Umba site (certainly hope its not a breach of intellectual property).

For colour, I tried to keep it minimal, Red, green and blue are popular fintech design colours. I stayed away from green and used red and blue sparingly, in a few situations like transitioning buttons etc.

thank you for this challenge
